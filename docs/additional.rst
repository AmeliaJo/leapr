Vibrational Frequency Spectrum
==============================================
The vibrational frequency spectrum (also known as the phonon frequency spectrum and phonon density of states) is a function that represents the available vibrational modes in a material that can be excited.

    The vibrational frequency spectrum for ZrH is shown.

The figure above shows the phonon density of states for zirconium hydride, ZrH. This shows the energies that a lattice vibration (phonon) could have, if they were to exist. When a thermal neutron collides with a material, it can collide elastically (interact with no phonons) or can collide inelastically (create or destroy phonons). A neutron will gain energy by destroying a phonon, or lose energy by creating a phonon. 

Note that most non-zero values for H in ZrH is centered about 0.14 eV, meaning that if phonons are excited in the material, they are likely to have an energy around 0.14 eV. So if a thermal neutron were to inelasticalyl scatter off of a hydrogen bound in ZrH, it would likely create a 0.14 eV phonon (thus losing 0.14 eV) or destroy a 0.14 eV phonon (thus gaining 0.14 eV). Similarly, it could create two phonons (thus losing about 0.28 eV) or destroy two phonons (thus gaining 0.28 eV). Regardless, we find that an inelastically scattered thermal neutron is likely to lose energy in multiples of about 0.14 eV, in this example.

In fact, when considering the cross section obtained using the above phonon spectrum, we find that a neutron with initial energy 0.5 eV will likely lose integer multiples of about 0.14 eV,
