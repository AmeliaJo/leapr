What choices does a user have?
===============================
LEAPR has the ability to represent coherent and incoherent thermal neutron scattering, both of which have an elastic and an inelastic component. If you are not familiar with these distinctions, consider visiting the "Theory" section. 

Below is a flowchart illustrating options available for data processing in LEAPR. The options are split into four main chunks, corresponding to the coherent/incoherent and elastic/inelastic options. Note that the only processing step that is strictly necessary is the continuous processing in the beginning, which describes both incoherent elastic and incoherent inelastic. The different options will be briefly discussed below.
